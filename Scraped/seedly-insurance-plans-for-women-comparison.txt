According to the Singapore Cancer Society, 
 
 39 Singaporeans are diagnosed with  cancer  every day; 
 15 people die from cancer every day; and 
 1 in 4 people may develop cancer in their lifetime 
 
 
 As females, we are slightly more prone to diseases than our male counterparts as well. 
 According to the National Cancer Centre Singapore, a total of 71,265 cancer cases were reported in Singapore between 2013 to 2017, and  51.6%  of the incidence of cancers occurred in females. 
 On the same note, breast cancer holds the  highest occurrence  among  Singaporean women , affecting 29.4% of the women. 
 Which reminds us how important it is to get  sufficient insurance  to protect ourselves.

 We can see that different plans offered varied types of coverage. 
 With more benefits and protection, we can expect the premiums to be more expensive. 
 As with all insurance plans, while we might be tempted to have the maximum level of coverage, it is important to balance between your own needs and the cost of premiums. 
 Because the last thing we want is to overspend on insurance. 
 Do speak with a licensed advisor to analyse your needs before deciding on which insurance plan to get for yourself! 
 Should You Get a Female Critical Illness Insurance Plan? 
 
 We know that  insurance  could be a BIG topic. 
 As with all insurance coverage, a female-specific insurance plan should be purchased if you would like to increase your coverage for female-specific diseases. 
 Given that some specific diseases are not included in the prescribed list of 37 critical illnesses, it could be beneficial to receive coverage for them. 
 In addition, with the free biennial health check-ups as one of the coverage benefits, such regular check-ups could be very useful as a  preventive measure . 
 That being said, do always assess your own insurance needs, and only purchase the ones that suit these needs the best. 
 In my opinion, such a plan should not replace your  critical illness  coverage, but could act as a complement to it. 
 If you’re considering it and wondering what you are  already covered by … 
 Perhaps it’s time to do a quick review of your  insurance coverage .
