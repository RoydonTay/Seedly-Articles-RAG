 To Be Eligible For Bank Loan 
 Usually, a good credit score works. 
 
 Key Differences Between HDB Loans and Bank Loans 
 HDB Loans Allow You to Pay Downpayment With Your CPF Money 
 The downside of an HDB loan is that a minimum  20% downpayment  is required. The upside is that you can use your  CPF savings  in your Ordinary Account to pay that downpayment. 
 When taking up a bank loan, a  25% downpayment  is required. Of which  5% needs to be in cash . 
 
 HDB Loans Have Higher Interest Rates Than Bank Loans 
 HDB loans have a higher interest rate of  2.6% . 
 The interest rate for HDB loans seldom changes since it is pegged to the interest rate of the CPF Ordinary Account. Banks peg their interest rate to SORA rates which fluctuate frequently. 
 If you are not a fan of the fluctuation or the uncertainty, an HDB loan is the simpler option to go for. 
 No Repayment Penalties If You Go for HDB Loans 
 A good part about taking up an HDB loan is that there is no penalty for paying back the loan early. 
 This is different when it comes to taking up a Bank loan for your property because the bank ultimately depends on the interest rate to make money! Paying early can result in a prepayment penalty from the bank. 
 HDB Loans Are More Forgiving 
 What happens if you fail on your loan repayment for your property? 
 HDB tends to be more forgiving when it comes to the late repayment of your loan. This is definitely not the case when it comes to the banks where the repercussions of not paying your loan is higher. 
 
 Bank vs HDB Loan: Interest Rate, Loan Amount And Other Various Factors 
 To better illustrate the differences, we decided to test out the calculators that are found on the HDB and various banks’ websites. 
 For illustration purposes, we assume: 
 
 Cost of new HDB BTO:  $300,000 
 Age of couple:  28 years old  for both 
 Repayment period:  25 years 
 
 Taking an HDB loan 
 
 Able to  loan up to 85 per cent  of the cost, at $255,000 
 CPF Ordinary Account’s interest rate is  fixed at 2.5 per cent  for the longest time (Note: you don’t have to  wipe out your CPF Ordinary Account! ) 
 The interest rate of an HDB loan is  0.1 per cent above the CPF Ordinary Account’s interest rate , as of now, the interest rate of an HDB loan is at  2.6 per cent 
 
 With the help of the  DBS Repayment Calculator , it worked out to be a repayment of  $1,157 per month  for a 25-year loan. 
 The loan repayment amount will be $347,057. 
 This brings the total cost of your HDB flat to  $392,057 . 
 Taking A 3-year Fixed Home Loan With DBS 
 
 Able to take a 20-year loan up to 75 per cent of the cost, at $225,000. 
 DBS Home Loan’s interest rate is set as  (3M SORA + 1% p.a.) , and for the first 3 years, it is fixed at 3.75 per cent p.a. 
 3M SORA refers to the 3-Month Compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) that is published on the  MAS website . The 3M SORA is  3.6944 per cent per annum (as of 9 Sep 2022). 
 We are assuming that the 3M SORA remains constant throughout the loan repayment period. 
 
 With this, and rounding up the interest rate thereafter to  4.7 per cent , it works out to a monthly repayment of ~ $1,448   per month . 
 The loan repayment amount will be $347,487. 
 This brings the total cost of your HDB flat to  $422,487 . 
 Total Cost of HDB Loan vs. Bank Loan 
 Bank  loans are more expensive  at the time of writing partly due to the US back-to-back interest rate hikes in response to inflation, and this is especially so  in 2022 and early 2023. 
 You may rejoice if you’re trying to invest in fixed deposits, but if you’re looking to borrow, you will definitely feel the pinch. 
 For more context, this is the  US Fed Rate Hikes  in 2022 and 2023:

 But whatever that goes up must come down. If you notice, the increase was at 0.25 per cent in 2023 instead of the aggressive increment in 2022. 
 Could this be a sign that it will dip in the next few announcements? 
 That said, you might also want to consider refinancing to save you some costs:

 What Is the SORA Interest Rate Benchmark And Why Is It Important? 
 
 Currently, most banks are using the SORA interest rate benchmark for their home loans. Amidst  rising interest rates , the SORA interest rate has also gone up over the past few months. 
 
 Mortgage Repayment Calculator 
 If you suddenly strike 4D or win the first prize in Toto and make a partial repayment towards the mortgage of your home, you’ll probably want to find out what your remaining mortgage repayment looks like. 
 All you need are the following details: 
 
 Loan Amount 
 Interest rate 
 Loan term 
 
 Simply plug that into a tool like the  DBS Repayment Calculator  to calculate the details of your home loan repayment. 
 
 What Can Homeowners Do to Refinance? 
 If you’re a homeowner on a bank loan right now, we know that you might be caught up in this heat. 
 It’s possibly time to refinance and consider the following: 
 
 Refinance to a fixed-rate loan package instead of a floating one 
 Making partial or full repayments in case interest rates rise significantly, using either cash or CPF funds 
 To mitigate risk, you might want to consider splitting or refinancing your loans into separate fixed or variable loans, effectively spreading risk across two different portfolios. 
 If you’re currently using a SIBOR-linked home loan package, it may be prudent to explore transitioning to a SORA-pegged package. Moreover, banks may potentially withdraw SIBOR-based packages soon as it will no longer be quoted from 2024, which could compel clients to migrate to other available packages and potentially increase their exposure to risk. 
 
 Lastly, it’s important to keep in mind that opting for a home loan package solely based on the lowest initial mortgage interest rate may not always be the wisest decision. 
 While low promotional rates may appear enticing, it’s crucial to assess the full financial implications over the entire duration of the package. The interest rates might experience a significant spike once the promotional period ends, or there could be additional fees and less favourable terms and conditions to consider. 
 Therefore, it’s prudent to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the overall costs throughout the package’s lifespan before making a choice. 
 
 The Seedly Community’s Take On HDB vs. Bank Loans 
 Seedly  is really blessed and fortunate that we have a helpful  Seedly community  where members are not selfish with their knowledge! 
 We conducted a poll on the types of loans our members use for their HDB. 
 Here’s just a sample of some of the most useful feedback which we collected: 
 
 Rais Bin Mahmud: 
HDB loan for convenience and not having to worry in future, due to the uncertainty and possibility of fluctuations in bank loans. 
 Amy Wang: 
Legal fees for HDB Loans are lower too. On top of that, you can choose to end your loan anytime if you wish to (for bank loans it depends on individual banks). 
 Christopher How: 
 An interesting point to note will be that future fluctuations are negated because you can refinance to another bank that offers a lower rate. In my case, I switched from OCBC to POSB for a better rate. The only worry comes when your loan is less than 100k.  Banks don’t do refinancing for loans below 100k. 
 Jay Tee: 
In my opinion, an HDB loan is always better. If you’re going for BTO, it’s 5% to secure the flat. This is followed by another 5% payment when it comes to collecting the keys. 
On the other hand, for Banks, it is usually a 10% payment followed by another 10% when collecting keys. If you reinvest the 10% down payment that you save from taking an HDB loan, you can cover the additional interest rate of HDB loans (especially if you plan to sell your BTO flat within 10 years or so?) 
Also, go for the longest HDB loan – this allows you to have more cash on hand to invest and puts you in a better position even if you’re unsure whether you will sell your flat in 10 years. You can always renegotiate for a shorter loan term in future if you do decide to pay off your HDB. 
 Timothy Tan: 
 I would take an HDB loan (since a down payment of 10% can be paid with CPF) and after 6 months of payment, I will refinance with other banks for lower interest rates.
