In Chinese, there’s a saying that goes人算不如天算 (Man Proposes, but God Disposes). Even if you don’t believe in a higher power, some things are out of control. 
 You could try and live a risk-free life, eat healthy, and  exercise regularly , but even then,  you can get a heart attack . 
 This is why when I travel, one of the first things I do is purchase  travel insurance . 
 In addition, I am always looking out for discounts and free gifts like  travel eSims , vouchers, Apple AirTags / ReboundTags, luggage and chances to win attractive prizes in lucky draws.
