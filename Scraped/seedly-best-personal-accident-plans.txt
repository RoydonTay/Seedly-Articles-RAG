In Singapore, enthusiastic insurance agents camping at MRT stations are aplenty. 
 While many are keen to explain their wide array of insurance products that’ll suit your needs. Unfortunately, as consumers, these plans are oftentimes difficult to comprehend. 
 And relying solely on the 5-minute pitch of an insurance agent may not necessarily result in you obtaining the best plan. 
 While there are hundreds of different insurance products out in the market,  personal accident plans  are perhaps one of the  most common and basic ones  which most consumers would consider.

 For those who’ve just started out researching on insurance and are looking for the best plan for your buck, here’s a guide on some of the  best personal accident plans  you can get. 
 Disclaimer: we’re neither sponsored nor are we giving advice, the opinions stated in this article are based on a simple comparison based on rudimentary criteria. Always seek professional advice or speak to your advisor for more information. 
 
 TL;DR: Which Is The Best Personal Accident (PA) Insurance For You? 
 Before we dive into the different plans, there’s a need to establish that the premiums and sum assured are based on the following profile: 
 
 A professional working in a desk-bound job 
 Does not travel overseas frequently for work 
 Does not ride a motorcycle, and isn’t a frequent pillion rider 
 Is a breadwinner of the family with dependants (e.g. children or elderly parents) 
 
 Why did we only choose white-collar as a base profile? 
 Because by 2030, two-thirds of Singaporeans will be in a white-collar job. 
 The other reason is also because the riskier your job is, chances are the premiums will go up too. 
 That said, we’re solely looking at  basic coverage . If you want comprehensive coverage, you would need to be prepared to pay more.

 What Is A Personal Accident Plan? 
 A personal accident plan is considered one of the  three   key insurance policies that you will need  in your lifetime. 
 It is a general insurance that complements your Medical and Hospitalisation insurance, and it provides you with financial support in the event of an unfortunate accident. 
 Payouts come in three forms: 
 
 On a reimbursement basis 
 Based on medical expenses incurred, or 
 Lump-sum payout (depending on the type of injuries sustained)   
 
 What’s Covered In A Personal Accident Plan?  
 In general, there are different types of coverages you can get from a personal accident plan. 
 The most common ones are: 
 Accidental Death Benefit 
 This is a key coverage under the personal accident scheme. It ensures that in the event of death during an accident, a payout will be given to the person’s dependants. 
 Permanent And Partial Disability 
 Another key coverage of the PA scheme. This ensures that in an event where the policyholder gets into an accident and becomes disabled, he or she will be given a form of compensation to tide them through. 
 Income Benefit 
 Usually applicable for employed policyholders at the time of injury who are unable to work due to the injury. The amount may differ from different policies. 
 Medical Expenses Coverage 
 Medical expenses reimbursements help alleviate your medical bills and are usually capped at a certain limit. 
 Daily Hospital Benefit 
 This is payable if you are hospitalised due to an accident. You can receive this even if you’re unemployed. 
 Note: This list is just a general overview of the usual coverage for personal accident insurance. Naturally, not all PA plans offer the same coverage. 
 
 Should You Get A Personal Accident Insurance Plan? 
 It is of course, optional for you to have a personal accident plan. 
 But it is definitely an added layer of protection – especially if you’re really accident-prone. 
 Source: giphy 
 But really, you should consider getting a PA plan if you are: 
 
 A sole breadwinner or have family members who are financially dependent on you 
 Commuting regularly on motorcycles, bicycles, or electric scooters 
 Participating in extreme sports 
 Travelling often for work or leisure 
 Working in a risky job 
 
 However, do keep in mind that your situation may affect the type of premiums you will pay for insurance. 
 Essentially, most insurance plans classify policyholders into these occupational class: 
 
 Occupational Class 1:  Professionals and persons engaged in executive, administrative or clerical duties such as accountant, lawyer, banker, doctor, teacher, nurse, secretary, etc. 
 Occupational Class 2:  Persons engaged in skilled or semi-skilled work and not exposed to hazardous conditions with some degree of risks, such as supervision of manual workers, totally administrative job in an industrial environment, professions of an outdoor nature, work involving overseas travel or work involving the occasional use of tools or machinery, such as foreman, grocer, hairdresser, salesman, tailor, surveyor, tourist guide, etc. 
 Occupational Class 3:  Persons engaged in occupations involving regular light to medium manual work with no substantial hazard which may increase the risk of sickness or accident. Examples are professions involving the use of tools or machinery, such as a carpenter, builder, painter, driver, technician, hawker, unarmed security guard, etc. 
 Occupational Class 4:  Persons in high-risk occupations involving heavy manual work including hot works. Examples are full-time national serviceman, fireman, policeman, armed security guard and woodworking machinist, etc. 
 
 For those working in  blue-collared jobs , the  insurance premiums you pay may be higher  than the prices listed in this article, due to the  different risk levels  of your job. 
 For the majority of working adults in white-collared office jobs, it’s best to get a personal accident plan that has decent coverage and annual premiums that won’t break the bank. 
 
 Things To Look Out For When Buying A Personal Accident Plan 
 I’ve spoken to a few of my insurance agent friends to find out more about what you should look out for when purchasing a personal accident insurance plan. 
 Other than the cost of annual premiums, other key things you’ve to look out for include: 
 Accidental Death And Disability Amount 
 Accidental death, disability, and medical reimbursements are highlights of a personal accident insurance plan, and in an event of a major accident, these claims are most useful. 
 Make sure that you have enough coverage in these areas when looking for the right plan. 
 Medical Reimbursements Amount 
 Make sure you are clear on your accidental medical reimbursement amount, and whether claims should be made per injury, per body part, or per year. 
 How Is “Accident” Defined In The Policy? Are There Any Extensions For The Definition Of An Accident? 
 Check if your PA policy includes accidents beyond the standard coverage. 
 For example, coverages for food poisoning, insect bites, terrorism are good to have. 
 Check The Schedule For The Indemnities For Accidental Dismember And Disability Amount  
 In your insurance policy, look under: Product Summary >> Accidental Dismemberment Benefit >> Schedule of Indemnity List. 
 Take note of what is being covered in your insurance, as well as the percentage insured amount. 
 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) And Chiropractor Claim Amounts 
 Check if your PA policy includes TCM and Chiropractor claims. 
 These are good to have, especially in cases of injuries where you have the option to seek alternative medical treatments. 
 For The Elderly 
 Check the maximum age of entry and the maximum renewable age. 
 It is better for you to choose one that has a renewable age of at least 85 years old, so that you will be protected for a much longer time. 
 
 Which Personal Accident Insurance Is Best For You? 
 The best personal accident plan is one that is catered to your customer profile. Here, I’ve picked out 6 of the best ones according to various profiles.

 Most individuals would be familiar with AIA – one of the biggest insurance companies in Singapore and very likely, you know someone who works there.
