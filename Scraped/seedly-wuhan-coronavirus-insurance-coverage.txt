 Travel Insurance Updates Regarding the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 
 “Due to the Wuhan virus outbreak, are my cancelled plans covered by travel insurance?” 
 
 If you’re travelling soon and are worried about COVID-19 coverage because you haven’t purchased your travel insurance yet… 
 Tough. 
 In general, most travel insurance providers  will not accept  claims related to COVID-19 (aka Wuhan coronavirus) after a certain cut-off date and time. 
 And that’s because the Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a  travel advisory  on  22 January 2020  for Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei, China, and all non-essential travel to mainland China. 
 So if you purchase your policy or make a novel coronavirus-related claim on 22 January 2020. 
 You’d most probably be rejected because the insurance companies consider COVID-2019-related risks as  ‘known risks’ . 
 Here are some of the notable announcements from the various insurance providers in Singapore:

 Note: most of these announcements are subject to situational changes 
 If you  bought your travel insurance policy early , you’ll probably have a chance of claiming coverage (touchwood). 
 For refunds for cancelled flights and trips, insurance providers recommend approaching the airlines you’re flying with. 
 Or the travel agency you booked your tour from. 
 Health Insurance Updates Regarding the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 
 
 The following insurance providers have mentioned that their health insurance policies will cover  hospitalisation and outpatient expenses  related to the coronavirus (depending on your purchased policy): 
 
 AIA 
 Allianz 
 AVIVA 
 AXA 
 NTUC Income 
 Prudential 
 
 Of note, Prudential’s private health insurance plan  Prudential PRUShield  covers hospital admission and pre- and post-hospitalisation medical costs 
 Life Insurance Updates Regarding the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 
 
 TokyoMarine  Life Insurance will give  $5,000  to policyholders — should they contract the novel coronavirus infection. 
 Policyholders need to submit proof of medical certification from Singapore hospitals specifying the diagnosis of the coronavirus. 
 NTUC Income  Star Assure life insurance plan comes with an optional rider to provide a payout if the insured is hospitalised in an intensive care unit for five days or more due to a serious infection, such as the 2019-nCoV. 
 Personal Accident Coverage Updates Regarding the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 
 NTUC   Income  will extend COVID-19 protection to individuals insured under Personal Accident Assurance with Infectious Disease cover and Personal Accident Infectious Disease policy – for six months until 31 August 2020. 
 The extended coverage will provide insured persons with a cash pay-out of $100 per day of hospitalisation in Singapore due to COVID-19, for up to 30 days. 
 There will also be a one-time pay-out of $10,000 if the insured person were to pass away due to COVID-19. 
 This pay-out will be in addition to other benefits that the insured person may have according to his or her PA plan. 
 To further support lower-income households in Singapore, Income is also extending COVID-19 benefits to the Income Family Micro-Insurance Scheme (IFMIS). 
 The IFMIS currently offers a pay-out of $5,000 if the insured person were to pass away or suffer a total and permanent disability. 
 The Scheme now includes COVID-19 benefits until 31 August 2020, which provide the insured person a cash pay-out of $200 per day of hospitalisation in Singapore due to COVID-19, for up to 30 days. 
 The claim is payable upon the first day of diagnosis. 
 Critical Illness Coverage Updates Regarding the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 
 
 In general, most critical illness (CI) coverage plans do not cover the novel coronavirus. 
 From what we understand, it might be admissable as an  End-Stage Lung Disease  if it fulfils the CI criteria of your policy. 
 Other Coronavirus-Related Insurance Announcements 
 Prudential  has announced that the PrUPanel Connect Concierge services in Raffles Hospital and Mount Alvernia Hospital have been temporarily suspended.
