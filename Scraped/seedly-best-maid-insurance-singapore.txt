 Personal Accident Insurance:  Sum assured of at least  $60,000 per year , and must cover sudden and unforeseen incidents resulting in permanent disability or death

 The  MSIG Maidplus Standard Plan  offers coverage in different areas for a comprehensive insurance plan. 
 For  $216  for a 26-month period, this plan includes coverage for rehiring/termination expenses if the maid is unfit for work (due to injury or illness) and replacement maid expenses due to death, injury or illness. 
 In addition, there is an alternative domestic help benefit of $50 per day (max. 30 days), which is quite a decent sum as compared to other plans. 
 Also, $300 for the domestic helper’s personal belongings is covered, a coverage that is less commonly seen among insurance plans.
