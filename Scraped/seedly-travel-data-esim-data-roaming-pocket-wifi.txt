What’s the best way to stay connected to the internet overseas? 
 Source: Giphy 
 The first option that comes to our mind is usually getting an overseas SIM card, but we often encounter the problem of not being able to purchase one at international airports. 
 When this happens, three other options allow you to stay connected – Travel eSims, Data Roaming and Portable/Pocket Wi-Fi. 
 If you’re still wondering which option to go for, this is an article you should bookmark because we’ve compiled some of the best  affordable options  that will be suitable for your travel needs! 
 
 TL;DR: Travel eSim vs Data Roaming vs Pocket Wi-Fi 
 
 
 For  solo travellers , a  travel eSim would be the cheapest option  most of the time.

 Travel eSim vs Data Roaming vs Pocket Wi-Fi: Which Should You Pick? 
 For solo travellers, a travel eSim would be the cheapest option most of the time. But if you’re travelling in a group, a pocket Wi-Fi device could be the more affordable option as you can split the cost. However, this assumes that your group does not split up and you are okay with being held liable for the loss or damage of the device! 
 If you’re undecided, here are a list of pros and cons of each product category: 
 
 
 
   Travel eSim Data Roaming Portable / Pocket Wi-Fi 
 
 
 
 
 Costs 1GB/7 days: From $4.50 1GB/7 days: From $8  Unlimited/7 days: From $17.01 
 
 
 Pros - Flexibility to choose from different providers - Better for individuals who generally use more data while travelling - Cost saving as you can share with more people 
- Better for group travelling and multi-country hopping 
- Once daily data usage exceeds the limit, router speed will slow down but can still connect and use 
 
 
 Cons - Need to adjust phone settings such as Access Point Name 
 - A constant need to turn on-and-off 
- Limited to data roaming plans provided by your telco 
- Might be limited to a number of countries only 
- Need to adjust phone settings such as Access Point Name - Requires charging 
- Need to place a deposit and can be chargeable for any damage or loss of router 
- Travel group must stay together to surf the web 
 
 
 

 Travel eSims 
 Travel eSims are the most affordable options with so many providers these days that we had to do a whole article on it: 
 
 In general, travel eSims from providers such as Airalo, alosim and more are cheaper than data roaming plans.

 SIMBA.sg (formerly known as TPG)’s the only provider that offers a pay-as-you-go roaming service. 
 The caveat is that you’ll be billed every 10MB used, hence if you’ve exceeded your usage even by 1MB, you will be charged additionally for the 1MB used. 
 M1’s data passport is also another unique plan as you’ll be using your local data instead of a separate overseas data plan when you’re overseas. 
 However, this might not be a good option if you’re constantly busting your local data. Note that there is also a $5 activation fee for M1 data passports. 
 Pro tip:  Try to activate your data roam at least one day before your trip in case you experience issues with activation.

 Travel Data Using Pocket Wi-Fi 
 Source: Giphy 
 Most of us travel to take a break from work or school, and with Whatsapp being an active platform for business conversations, a portable or pocket Wi-Fi is an option for those who don’t see the need for calling or SMS-es. 
 Before choosing one, there’re a couple of factors to consider before renting: 
 
 Size: A heavy-duty router that has stronger battery life would tend to be bulkier. You’ll need to choose between convenience and durability 
 Download speed: Download speed will affect your connectivity and time spend on retrieving information 
 Devices limit: There is usually a limit of up to 5 paired devices hence not everyone can use it at the same time if you’re travelling in a large group. 
 
 These are some affordable wifi rental service providers in Singapore:

 Changi’s Wi-Fi router is often a go-to option for travellers as you can collect it at the airport before you depart. It can be paired with up to 5 devices and have unlimited data in selected countries. 
 Pro tip:  A Wi-Fi router with a download speed of 150 Mbps should suffice if you’re only accessing social media and Google. However, you may need a device that has a download speed of 600 Mbps or more for widespread access such as streaming services.
