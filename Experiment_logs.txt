    "Summarise the context provided to be shorter in length, but remain understandable to you. \nContext : I started off this year with the goal to make the most out of my finances. \n To achieve this goal, I plan to  maximise my
    savings ,  spend minimally  and  start investing . \n But, there was one thing that I didn’t know I missed out on. \n I received a letter informing me that my health insurance was due for renewal – an annual premium of $400++.
    \n That’s when I noticed that I should pay more attention to the insurance I own. \n Source: Tenor \n Let’s be honest, insurance is one of the things we often overlook because we just want to “settle and move on”. \n But we 
    also don’t want to end up not knowing where our money is going into. \n Additionally, there are various reasons why one should consider reviewing, including changes in life stages and careers. \n With commitments such as a 
    car or house in the near future, I would also need  car insurance/auto insurance , and  home insurance . \n This prompted me to create my own excel sheet to track all my insurance plans and sum assured. \n It is\n\nto say, 
    most people don’t really know what being “over-insured” and “under-insured” means. \n I’ve recently come across someone who holds  five whole-life insurance policies  and is spending at least  $1,200 per month  just on these
    policies! \n Source: Giphy \n For the uninitiated, being overinsured means you’ve overbought insurance plans which might potentially leave you  struggling financially  or paying more than what you might need and as a result,
    “overpaying” some premiums. \n On the flip side, being underinsured means there are gaps in your insurance coverage which could leave you vulnerable to financial risks and uncertainties. \n So, the next question you’ll ask 
    is… \n Back to top \n How Much Insurance Coverage Do You Need? \n The general rule of thumb is to assess based on your current circumstance. \n Are you a student? A first jobber? A mid-career switcher? A new parent? \n What’s
    your occupation and is there a physical risk imposed? Do you have a family history of cancer? \n It all"

  "output": " When getting insurance, it's important to consider the level of coverage you need based on your individual circumstances. This may involve evaluating your assets, income, and debts, as well as any potential risks or 
  liabilities you may face. Additionally, you should consider the type of insurance you need, such as health, life, disability, or long-term care insurance, and how much coverage you require. It's also important to carefully review 
  the policy terms and conditions, including the deductible, co-pay, and coverage limits, to ensure you understand what is covered and what is not."

Without RAG:
When getting insurance, there are several factors to consider. Here are some key things to think about:

1. Coverage: Make sure the policy provides adequate coverage for your needs. Consider the potential risks and losses you could face, and choose a policy that offers sufficient protection.
2. Cost: Insurance can be expensive, so it's important to consider the cost of the policy when making your decision. Compare different policies and providers to find the best value for your money.
3. Deductible: A deductible is the amount you must pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. Consider how much you can afford to pay in a given year, and choose a policy with a deductible that's manageable for you.
4. Limits: Check the limits of your policy to see how much coverage you have for different types of losses. Make sure the limits are sufficient to cover your potential losses.
5. Policy terms: Read the fine print of your policy to understand the terms and conditions of your coverage. Pay attention to things like the policy period, premium payment schedule, and any exclusions or limitations.
6. Provider reputation: Choose an insurance provider with a good reputation for paying claims promptly and fairly. Research the company's financial stability and customer service record before making a decision.
7. Additional features: Some policies may offer additional features, such as accidental death and dismemberment coverage or optional riders. Consider whether these extras are worth the extra cost.
8. Renewability: Make sure your policy is renewable, so you don't have to worry about losing coverage when the term ends.
9. Claims process: Understand how the claims process works and how long it takes to get reimbursed in the event of a loss. Choose an insurer with a streamlined claims process that can help you get back on your feet quickly.
10. Customer service: Consider the level of customer support offered by the insurance provider. Choose a company with friendly, knowledgeable representatives who can answer your questions and provide assistance when you need it.
